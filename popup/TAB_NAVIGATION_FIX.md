# Tab Navigation Fix

## Issue

The tab navigation was not working in the popup UI. Clicking on tabs did not switch the active panel.

## Root Cause

The tab manager was looking for a `data-tab` attribute on the tab buttons, but the HTML structure was using the `aria-controls` attribute to specify which panel each button controls.

## Fixes Applied

1. Updated the tab manager to use `aria-controls` attribute instead of `data-tab`:

   ```javascript
   // Changed from:
   const targetPanel = button.getAttribute('data-tab');

   // To:
   const targetPanel = button.getAttribute('aria-controls');
   ```

2. Enhanced button state updates for accessibility:

   ```javascript
   button.setAttribute('aria-selected', isActive.toString());
   button.setAttribute('tabindex', isActive ? '0' : '-1');
   ```

3. Added detailed logging for debugging:
   - Log when tab buttons are initialized
   - Log when tabs are clicked
   - Log which panels are being shown/hidden

## Result

- Tab navigation now works correctly
- Clicking on tabs properly switches the panel display
- Accessibility attributes are correctly updated

## Testing Instructions

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this extension folder
4. Click the extension icon to open the popup
5. Try clicking on different tabs (Settings, History, Favorites, etc.)
6. Verify that the tabs change correctly
7. Open Chrome DevTools console to see detailed logging

## Notes

- The tab manager properly initializes all tab modules during startup
- Each tab module handles its own initialization and event bindings
- The modular structure makes debugging and maintenance much easier
